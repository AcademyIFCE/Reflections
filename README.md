# Reflections

Made with Swift Catalyst + Nuvem framework

## Run the project locally

Currently, in order to run the project locally, you have to change the App's bundle identifier to something new, linked to your Account, and do the same to the iCloud container. You can change both of them inside xcode, clicking on target, and going to the Signing and Capabilities tab.
